# MQ-2 Gas Sensor Fire Alarm System (Arduino-Based)

This project is a prototype fire alarm system built using the MQ-2 gas sensor to detect the presence of smoke or gas. 
The system triggers both audio and visual alerts when concentration levels exceed a calibrated threshold. The objective 
of this project was to explore basic sensor interfacing, real-time data monitoring, and early-stage safety system logic 
using affordable and easily accessible hardware components.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The aim was to design a simple fire alarm prototype that can detect smoke or gas in real time and provide immediate alerts. 
While not intended for commercial or industrial use, the prototype demonstrates the fundamental ideas behind sensor-driven 
safety systems.
